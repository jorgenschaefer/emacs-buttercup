;;; Commentary:

;; Buttercup is a behavior-driven development framework for testing
;; Emacs Lisp code. It is heavily inspired by the Jasmine test
;; framework for JavaScript.

;; A test suite begins with a call to the Buttercup macro `describe` with
;; the first parameter describing the suite and the rest being the body
;; of code that implements the suite.

;; (describe "A suite"
;;   (it "contains a spec with an expectation"
;;     (expect t :to-be t)))

;; The ideas for project were shamelessly taken from Jasmine
;; <https://jasmine.github.io>.

;; All the good ideas are theirs. All the problems are mine.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'buttercup-compat)
(require 'format-spec)
(require 'ert nil t)
(require 'warnings)

;; A base error for all errors raised by buttercup.
(define-error 'buttercup-error-base "error")
;; Buttercup internals error, raised on internal implementation
;; inconsistencies.
