# Introduction

Buttercup is a behavior-driven development framework for testing Emacs
Lisp code. It does not depend on any other Emacs Lisp libraries. It
has a clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests.

It is heavily inspired by [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/). So
heavily inspired, in fact, that most of this page is more or less a
verbatim copy of the
[Jasmine introduction](https://jasmine.github.io/edge/introduction.html).

All code in this file can be run by Buttercup’s built-in markdown test
runner. Just use `make test` in the project directory to see the
output.

## Suites: `describe` Your Tests

A test suite begins with a call to the Buttercup macro `describe` with
the first parameter describing the suite and the rest being the body
of code that implements the suite.

```Emacs-Lisp
(describe "A suite"
  (it "contains a spec with an expectation"
    (expect t :to-be t)))
```

## Specs

Specs are defined by calling the Buttercup macro `it`, which, like
`describe` takes a string and code. The string is the title of the
spec and the code is the spec, or test. A spec contains one or more
expectations that test the state of the code. An expectation in
Buttercup is an assertion that is either true or false. A spec with
all true expectations is a passing spec. A spec with one or more false
expectations is a failing spec.

### It’s Just Functions

The code arguments to `describe` and `it` is just turned into
functions internally, so they can contain any executable code
necessary to implement the rules. Emacs Lisp scoping rules apply, so
make sure to define your spec file to be lexically scoped.

```Emacs-Lisp
(describe "A suite is just a function"
  :var (a)
  (it "and so is a spec"
    (setq a t)
    (expect a :to-be t)))
```

## Expectations

Expectations are expressed with the `expect` function. Its first
argument is the actual value. The second argument is a test, followed
by expected values for the test to compare the actual value against.

If there is no test, the argument is simply tested for being non-nil.
This can be used by people who dislike the matcher syntax.

### Matchers

Each matcher implements a boolean comparison between the actual value
and the expected value. It is responsible for reporting to Buttercup
if the expectation is true or false. Buttercup will then pass or fail
the spec.

Any matcher can evaluate to a negative assertion by prepending it with
the `:not` matcher.

```Emacs-Lisp
(describe "The :to-be matcher compares with `eq'"
  (it "and has a positive case"
    (expect t :to-be t))
  (it "and can have a negative case"
    (expect nil :not :to-be t)))
```

### Included Matchers

Buttercup has a rich set of matchers included. Each is used here — all
expectations and specs pass. There is also the ability to write custom
matchers (see the `buttercup-define-matcher` macro for further
information) for when a project’s domain calls for specific assertions
that are not included below.

```Emacs-Lisp
(describe "Included matchers:"
  (it "The :to-be matcher compares with `eq'"
    (let* ((a 12)
           (b a))
      (expect a :to-be b)
      (expect a :not :to-be nil)))

  (describe "The :to-equal matcher"
    (it "works for simple literals and variables"
      (let ((a 12))
        (expect a :to-equal 12)))

    (it "should work for compound objects"
      (let ((foo '((a . 12) (b . 34)))
            (bar '((a . 12) (b . 34))))
        (expect foo :to-equal bar))))

  (it "The :to-have-same-items-as matcher compares two lists as sets"
    (let ((first (list "a" "b" "c"))
          (second (list "c" "a" "b"))
          (third (list "a" "c" "d"))
          (fourth (list "a" "b")))
      (expect first :to-have-same-items-as second)
      (expect second :to-have-same-items-as first)
      (expect first :not :to-have-same-items-as third)
      (expect third :not :to-have-same-items-as second)
      (expect first :not :to-have-same-items-as fourth)
      (expect fourth :not :to-have-same-items-as first)))

  (it "The :to-match matcher is for regular expressions"
    (let ((message "foo bar baz"))
      (expect message :to-match "bar")
      (expect message :to-match (rx "bar"))
      (expect message :not :to-match "quux")))

  (it "The :to-be-truthy matcher is for boolean casting testing"
    (let (a
          (foo "foo"))
      (expect foo :to-be-truthy)
      (expect a :not :to-be-truthy)))

  (it "The :to-contain matcher is for finding an item in a list"
    (let ((a '("foo" "bar" "baz")))
      (expect a :to-contain "bar")
      (expect a :not :to-contain "quux")))

  (it "The :to-be-less-than matcher is for mathematical comparisons"
    (let ((pi 3.1415926)
          (e 2.78))
      (expect e :to-be-less-than pi)
      (expect pi :not :to-be-less-than e)))

  (it "The :to-be-greater-than matcher is for mathematical comparisons"
    (let ((pi 3.1415926)
          (e 2.78))
      (expect pi :to-be-greater-than e)
      (expect e :not :to-be-greater-than pi)))

  (it "The :to-be-close-to matcher is for precision math comparison"
    (let ((pi 3.1415926)
          (e 2.78))
      (expect pi :not :to-be-close-to e 2)
      (expect pi :to-be-close-to e 0)))

  (describe "The :to-throw matcher"
    (it "is for testing if an expression throws an exception"
      (expect (+ 1 2) :not :to-throw)
      (expect (+ a 1) :to-throw))
    (it "accepts a symbol to check for the signal thrown"
      (expect (/ 1 0) :not :to-throw 'void-variable)
      (expect (+ a 1) :to-throw 'void-variable))
    (it "optionally matches arguments to signals"
        (expect (+ a 1) :not :to-throw 'void-variable '(b))
        (expect (+ a 1) :to-throw 'void-variable '(a)))
	(it "matches inherited signals"
	  (expect (signal 'overflow-error nil) :to-throw 'overflow-error)
	  (expect (signal 'overflow-error nil) :to-throw 'arith-error)
	  (expect (signal 'overflow-error nil) :to-throw 'error)
	  (expect (signal 'arith-error nil) :not :to-throw 'overflow-error)
	  (expect (signal 'arith-error nil) :to-throw 'arith-error)
	  (expect (signal 'arith-error nil) :to-throw 'error))))
```

If you are migrating from ERT, you can also use `should` and similar
macros inside a buttercup test just like you would inside an
`ert-deftest` form.

```Emacs-Lisp
(require 'ert)
(describe "ERT support"
  (it "allows you to use ERT macros in tests"
    (let* ((a 12)
           (b a))
      (should (= a b))
      (should-not (eq a nil))
      (should-error (error "Throws an error")))))
```

## Grouping Related Specs with `describe`

The `describe` macro is for grouping related specs. The string
parameter is for naming the collection of specs, and will be
concatenated with specs to make a spec’s full name. This aids in
finding specs in a large suite. If you name them well, your specs read
as full sentences in traditional
[BDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) style.

```Emacs-Lisp
(describe "A spec"
  (it "is just a function, so it can contain any code"
    (let ((foo 0))
      (setq foo (1+ foo))

      (expect foo :to-equal 1)))

  (it "can have more than one expectation"
    (let ((foo 0))
      (setq foo (1+ foo))

      (expect foo :to-equal 1)
      (expect t :to-equal t))))
```

### Declaring Variables

The `describe` macro supports the optional `:var` and `:var*` args.
These bind variables for the suite by passing them as a varlist to the
`let` and `let*` form respectively. Only one instance of `:var` or
`:var*` is allowed, and it must come first in the `describe` form.  It
can not be interspersed between `it` statements.

```Emacs-Lisp
(describe "A spec using :VAR"
  :var ((foo 1))
  (it "has access to the variables bound in :VAR"
    (expect foo :to-be 1)))

(describe "A spec using :VAR*"
  :var* ((foo 1)
        (bar (1+ foo)))
  (it "has access to the variables bound in :VAR* which can refer \
to symbols already bound"
    (expect bar :to-be 2)))
```

It's important to note that `lexical-binding` must be `non-nil` for
`:var` and `:var*` to work properly. Within a test file this is
usually set using a local file variable.

Using `:var` and `:var*` works just like the `let` equivalents, but
it's recommended to use the `:var` format to be future proof. Future
internal changes in `buttercup` could break suites using `let`.

### Setup and Teardown

To help a test suite DRY up any duplicated setup and teardown code,
Buttercup provides the `before-each`, `after-each`, `before-all` and
`after-all` special forms.

As the name implies, code blocks defined with `before-each` are called
once before each spec in the `describe` is run, and the `after-each`
code blocks are called once after each spec.

Here is the same set of specs written a little differently. The
variable under test is defined at the top-level scope — the `describe`
block — and initialization code is moved into a `before-each` block.
The `after-each` block resets the variable before continuing.

```Emacs-Lisp
(describe "A spec using `before-each' and `after-each'"
  :var (foo)
  (before-each
   (when (not foo)
     (setq foo 0))
   (setq foo (1+ foo)))

  (after-each
   (setq foo 0))

  (it "is just a function, so it can contain any code"
    (expect foo :to-equal 1))

  (it "can have more than one expectation"
    (expect foo :to-equal 1)
    (expect t :to-equal t)))
```

The `before-all` form is called only once before all the specs in
`describe` are run, and the `after-all` form is called after all specs
finish. These functions can be used to speed up test suites with
expensive setup and teardown.

However, be careful using `before-all` and `after-all`! Since they are
not reset between specs, it is easy to accidentally leak state between
your specs so that they erroneously pass or fail.

```Emacs-Lisp
(describe "A spec using `before-all' and `after-all'"
  :var (foo)
  (before-all
   (setq foo 1))

  (after-all
   (setq foo 0))

  (it "sets the initial value of foo before specs run"
    (expect foo :to-equal 1)
    (setq foo (1+ foo)))

  (it "does not reset foo between specs"
    (expect foo :to-equal 2)))
```

### Nesting `describe` Blocks

Calls to `describe` can be nested, with specs defined at any level.
This allows a suite to be composed as a tree of functions. Before a
spec is executed, Buttercup walks down the tree executing each
`before-each` function in order. After the spec is executed, Buttercup
walks through the `after-each` functions similarly.

```Emacs-Lisp
(describe "A spec"
  :var (foo)
  (before-each
   (setq foo 0)
   (setq foo (1+ foo)))

  (after-each
   (setq foo 0))

  (it "is just a function, so it can contain any code"
    (expect foo :to-equal 1))

  (it "can have more than one expectation"
    (expect foo :to-equal 1)
    (expect t :to-equal t))

  (describe "nested inside a second describe"
    (let (bar)
      (before-each
       (setq bar 1))

      (it "can reference both scopes as needed"
        (expect foo :to-equal bar)))))
```

## Disabling Suites

Suites and specs can be disabled by marking them as pending with the
`xdescribe` and `xit` macros, respectively. Any suites or specs inside
a `xdescribe' suite is also pending. Pending suites and specs will be
listed as pending in the results, but the containing code will not be
run.

```Emacs-Lisp
(xdescribe "A spec"
  :var (foo)
  (before-each
    (setq foo 0)
    (setq foo (1+ foo)))

  (it "is just a function, so it can contain any code"
    (expect foo :to-equal 1)))
```

## Pending Specs

Pending specs do not run, but will be listed in the results.

Any spec declared with `xit` is marked as pending.

Any spec declared without a function body will also be marked as
pending in results.

```Emacs-Lisp
(describe "Pending specs"
  (xit "can be declared using `xit'"
    (expect t :to-be nil))

  (it "can be declared with `it' but without a body"))
```

## Spies

Buttercup has test double functions called spies. While other
frameworks call these mocks and similar, we call them spies, because
their main job is to spy in on function calls. Also, Jasmine calls
them spies, and so do we. A spy can stub any function - whether it
already exists or not - and tracks calls
to it and all arguments. Spies may only be created in `before-each` or
`it` blocks. Spies are removed and all counters reset after each spec
and its `after-each` blocks have completed. There are
special matchers for interacting with spies. The
`:to-have-been-called` matcher will return true if the spy was called
at all. The `:to-have-been-called-with` matcher will return true if
the argument list matches any of the recorded calls to the spy.

```Emacs-Lisp
(describe "A spy"
  :var (foo bar)
  (before-each
   (setf (symbol-function 'foo)
         (lambda (value)
           (setq bar value)))

   (spy-on 'foo)

   (foo 123)
   (foo 456 "another param"))

  (it "tracks that the spy was called"
    (expect 'foo :to-have-been-called)
    (foo 789))

  (it "resets tracking after each spec"
    (expect 'foo :not :to-have-been-called-with 789))

  (describe "that is defined in a nested `describe'"
    (before-each
      (spy-on 'foo :and-return-value 1))
    (it "will override any outer spy"
      (expect (foo 789) :to-equal 1)
      (expect 'foo :not :to-have-been-called-with 123)))

  (it "will not be active outside it's scope"
    (expect (foo 789) :to-equal nil))

  (it "tracks all arguments of its calls"
    (expect 'foo :to-have-been-called-with 123)
    (expect 'foo :to-have-been-called-with 456 "another param"))

  (it "stops all execution on a function"
    (expect bar :to-be nil)))
```

The `:to-have-been-called-with` matcher can also take special
`spy-arg-matcher` arguments to perform more complex tests of the
argument.  For example, if you only care about the second argument to
the function call you might want to express "first argument can be
anything".  This can be achieved with `spy-arg-matcher-any`:

``` Emacs-Lisp
(it "second argument matches :keyword"
  (spy-on 'bar)
  (bar "anything" :keyword)
  (expect 'bar :to-have-been-called-with (spy-arg-matcher-any) :keyword))
```

Other built in matcher is `(spy-arg-matcher-any-of list)` witch
matches if argument is `equal` to any of the elements of `list`.
Finally, you can construct your own custom matcher by passing a single
argument lambda to `(spy-arg-matcher pred)` to use that predicate to
test the argument:

``` Emacs-Lisp
(cl-defstruct person name)

(it "was called with a person struct"
  (spy-on 'bar)
  (bar (person :name "XYZ"))
  (expect 'bar :to-have-been-called-with (spy-arg-matcher #'person-p)))
```

The `:to-have-been-called-times` matcher will return true if the spy
was called a certain number of times.

```Emacs-Lisp
(describe "A spy"
  :var (foo bar)
  (before-each
   (setf (symbol-function 'foo)
         (lambda (value)
           (setq bar value)))

   (spy-on 'foo)

   (foo 123)
   (foo 456 "another param"))

  (it "tracks that the spy was called twice"
    (expect 'foo :to-have-been-called-times 2)))
```

### Spies: `:and-call-through`

The keyword argument `:and-call-through` to `spy-on` will make the spy
call the original function instead of returning `nil`.

```Emacs-Lisp
(describe "A spy, when configured to call through"
  :var (bar set-bar get-bar fetched-bar)
  (before-each
    (fset 'set-bar (lambda (val)
                     (setq bar val)))
    (fset 'get-bar (lambda ()
                     bar))

    (spy-on 'get-bar :and-call-through)

    (set-bar 123)
    (setq fetched-bar (get-bar)))

  (it "tracks that the spy was called"
    (expect 'get-bar :to-have-been-called))

  (it "should not affect other functions"
    (expect bar :to-equal 123))

  (it "when called returns the requested value"
    (expect fetched-bar :to-equal 123)))
```

### Spies: `:and-return-value`

The keyword argument `:and-return-value` specifies the value the
spied-on function should return.

```Emacs-Lisp
(describe "A spy, when configured to fake a return value"
  :var (bar set-bar get-bar fetched-bar)
  (before-each
    (fset 'set-bar (lambda (val)
                     (setq bar val)))
    (fset 'get-bar (lambda ()
                     bar))

    (spy-on 'get-bar :and-return-value 745)

    (set-bar 123)
    (setq fetched-bar (get-bar)))

  (it "tracks that the spy was called"
    (expect 'get-bar :to-have-been-called))

  (it "should not affect other functions"
    (expect bar :to-equal 123))

  (it "when called returns the requested value"
    (expect fetched-bar :to-equal 745)))
```

### Spies: `:and-call-fake`

The keyword argument `:and-call-fake` delegates calls to a supplied
function.

```Emacs-Lisp
(describe "A spy, when configured with an alternate implementation"
  :var (bar set-bar get-bar fetched-bar)
  (before-each
    (fset 'set-bar (lambda (val)
                     (setq bar val)))
    (fset 'get-bar (lambda ()
                     bar))

    (spy-on 'get-bar :and-call-fake (lambda () 1001))

    (set-bar 123)
    (setq fetched-bar (get-bar)))

  (it "tracks that the spy was called"
    (expect 'get-bar :to-have-been-called))

  (it "should not affect other functions"
    (expect bar :to-equal 123))

  (it "when called returns the requested value"
    (expect fetched-bar :to-equal 1001)))
```

### Spies: `:and-throw-error`

With the keyword argument `:and-throw-error`, all calls to the spy
will `signal` the specified value as an error.

```Emacs-Lisp
(describe "A spy, when configured to throw an error"
  :var (bar set-bar get-bar fetched-bar)
  (before-each
    (fset 'set-bar (lambda (val)
                     (setq bar val)))
    (fset 'get-bar (lambda ()
                     bar))

    (spy-on 'get-bar :and-throw-error 'error))

  (it "throws the error"
    (expect (get-bar)
            :to-throw 'error)))
```

### Other tracking properties

Every call to a spy is tracked and exposed using the `spy-calls`
accessor. This tracks both successful calls and calls that throw
errors.

`spy-calls-any` returns `nil` if the spy has not been called at all,
and then `t` once at least one call happens. `spy-calls-count` returns
the number of times the spy was called. `spy-calls-args-for` returns
the arguments passed to a given call (by index). `spy-calls-all-args`
returns the arguments to all calls. `spy-calls-all` returns the
context (current buffer, arguments passed and return status) of all
calls.  `spy-calls-most-recent` returns the context of the most recent
call. `spy-calls-first` returns the context for the first call.

Contexts are represented by instances of the `spy-context` struct with
the slots `args`, `current-buffer`, `return-value` and
`thrown-signal`. The `return-value` and `thrown-signal` slots
represent the return status. Calling `spy-context-return-value` for a
context representing a raised signal (or vice versa) will raise an
error. Test the context type with `spy-context-return-p` and
`spy-context-thrown-p`.

Finally, `spy-calls-reset` clears all tracking for a spy.

```Emacs-Lisp
(describe "A spy"
  :var (set-foo foo)
  (before-each
    (fset 'set-foo (lambda (val &rest ignored)
                     (setq foo val)))
    (spy-on 'set-foo))

  (it "tracks if it was called at all"
    (expect (spy-calls-any 'set-foo)
            :to-equal
            nil)

    (set-foo 5)

    (expect (spy-calls-any 'set-foo)
            :to-equal
            t))

  (it "tracks the number of times it was called"
    (expect (spy-calls-count 'set-foo)
            :to-equal
            0)

    (set-foo 2)
    (set-foo 3)

    (expect (spy-calls-count 'set-foo)
            :to-equal
            2))

  (it "tracks the arguments of each call"
    (set-foo 123)
    (set-foo 456 "baz")

    (expect (spy-calls-args-for 'set-foo 0)
            :to-equal
            '(123))

    (expect (spy-calls-args-for 'set-foo 1)
            :to-equal
            '(456 "baz")))

  (it "tracks the arguments of all calls"
    (set-foo 123)
    (set-foo 456 "baz")

    (expect (spy-calls-all-args 'set-foo)
            :to-equal
            '((123)
              (456 "baz"))))

  (it "can provide the context and arguments to all calls"
    (set-foo 123)

    (expect (spy-calls-all 'set-foo)
            :to-equal
            `(,(make-spy-context :current-buffer (current-buffer)
                                 :args '(123)))))

  (it "has a shortcut to the most recent call"
    (set-foo 123)
    (set-foo 456 "baz")

    (expect (spy-calls-most-recent 'set-foo)
            :to-equal
            (make-spy-context :current-buffer (current-buffer)
                              :args '(456 "baz"))))

  (it "has a shortcut to the first call"
    (set-foo 123)
    (set-foo 456 "baz")

    (expect (spy-calls-first 'set-foo)
            :to-equal
            (make-spy-context :current-buffer (current-buffer)
                              :args '(123))))

  (it "tracks the return values and error signals of each call"
    ;; Set up `set-foo' so that it can either return a value or throw
    ;; an error
    (spy-on 'set-foo :and-call-fake
            (lambda (val &rest ignored)
              (if (>= val 0)

## Warnings in tests

By default, Buttercup captures any warning emitted during a test and
displays them all after the test completes in order to keep the output
readable. If you need to suppress this (for example if your test deals
with the warnings itself), you can use the macro
`buttercup-suppress-warning-capture`, which works like `progn` but
suppresses Buttercup's warning capturing within the body.

```Emacs-Lisp
(describe "A test"
  (it "can issue warnings while running"
    (display-warning 'buttercup "This warning should be visible after the test report.")
    (expect (+ 2 2) :to-equal 4))

  (it "can capture its own warnings as part of the test"
    (buttercup-suppress-warning-capture
      (let ((warning-text
             (format "This warning, issued at %s should be sent to the *Warnings* buffer as normal."
                     (current-time-string))))
        (display-warning 'buttercup warning-text)
        (expect (with-current-buffer "*Warnings*"
                  (buffer-string))
                :to-match (regexp-quote warning-text))))))
```
